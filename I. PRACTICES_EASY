1. /*Duplicate Table for Comparison*/

select E.name as employee
from employee as E, employee as M
where E.managerid = M.id and E.salary>M.salary;


2. /*uses LEFT JOIN to combine tables*/

select firstname, lastname, city, state
from Person left join Address on person.personid = address.personid;


3. /* get Duplicate Emails using GROUPBY to squezz out the unique emails*/
/* remember when creadting table countnum, include email in it */

select email 
from (select email, count(id) as num from person group by email) as countnum 
where num>1;


4. /* Customers Who Never Order */

/* only count once when same name customers appear */
/* wrong
select name as customers
from (select name, count(orders.id) as num from customers left join orders on customers.id = orders.customerid group by name) as t 
where num=0;
*/

/* using NOT IN and remember need to have a sub-query here */

select name from customers
where customers.id not in (select customerid from orders);


5. use DELETE and SELF JOIN to Delete Duplicate Emails


/* 
Please write a DELETE statement and DO NOT write a SELECT statement.
Write your T-SQL query statement below
*/

/* works on MySQL but not MySQL Server */
delete from person where id not in
(select * from (select min(id) from person group by email) as p);

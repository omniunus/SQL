1. JOIN, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, SELF JOIN

   JOIN
   SELECT xx FROM xxTable INNER JOIN xxxTable USING (xx)
or
   SELECT xx FROM Table1 INNER JOIN Table2 on xx.Table1 = xx.Table2

INNER JOIN
   Match each keys from one table to another, in Venn diagram it's the middle part, like what we have for A & B.
   If something only exist in one table but not the other, that part would not be shown after appllied inner join.
   
LEFT JOIN
   Most commonly used.  For joining two tables together using a same key. Everything in the left table will be included but for the right table is not.
   Eg: select xx from t1 left join t2 on t1.xxx = t2.xxx;

SELF JOIN
MySQL SELF JOIN is using INNER JOIN
   Use it when need to compare same table rows, (or hierarchical data)
   Eg: SELECT xx FROM Table t1, Table t2 WHERE xxCondition;
   Eg: DELETE xx FROM Table t1, Table t2 WHERE xxCondition;
   
   
2. DELETE
   DELETE FROM xxTable
   WHERE xxCondition;

1. INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, SELF JOIN

INNER JOIN
   Match each keys from one table to another, in Venn diagram it's the middle part, like what we have for A & B.
   If something only exist in one table but not the other, that part would not be shown after appllied inner join.
   
LEFT JOIN
   Most commonly used.  For joining two tables together using a same key. Everything in the left table will be included but for the right table is not.
   Eg: select xx from t1 left join t2 on t1.xxx = t2.xxx;

SELF JOIN
   Use it when need to compare same table rows, (or hierarchical data)
   Eg: SELECT xx FROM Table t1, Table t2 WHERE xxCondition;
   Eg: DELETE xx FROM Table t1, Table t2 WHERE xxCondition;
   
   
2. DELETE
   DELETE FROM xxTable
   WHERE xxCondition;
